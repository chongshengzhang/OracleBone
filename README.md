IJCAI Demo Paper



Currently, this page is to share the resources of our demo paper.  At the current stage, only the reviewers can access the corresponding software/resources. 


To run our codes, python3, numpy, opencv, pyqt5, Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch should be installed first. 


In the future, we will share all the software tools and resources of this work with the community. 



If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach me by email: chongsheng.zhang@yahoo.com.


Thank you so much for your attention.
