Demo Paper

Dear Friends:

Currently, this page is to show the demonstrated system presented in our demo paper.  At the current stage, only the reviewers with a download (SkyDrive) code can access the corresponding software/programs. In the future, we will share all the software tools and the source codes of our algorithms with the community. 


To run our codes, python3, numpy, opencv, pyqt5, Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch should be installed first. 


The SkyDrive (Baidu NetDisk) address of the software tools depicted in our demo paper: 
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1os-YneO-kUxrMtA1uH5FlA


The SkyDrive download code is provided in the submitted paper under review (for now, only the reviewers of this paper can access the demonstrated system.). 



If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach me by email: chongsheng.zhang@yahoo.com.


Thank you so much for your attention.
